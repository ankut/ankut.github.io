If only pretax contributions are made, the entire withdrawal is taxable as ordinary income. None of the funds may be withdrawn tax-free. If an investor maintains an IRA account that has pretax and after-tax contributions and makes withdrawals, the IRS considers withdrawals to come from both sources. Therefore, a portion of the withdrawal is taxable and the other portion is tax-free. Withdrawals from a Roth IRA are tax-free if certain conditions are met." },

Under SEC Regulation SHO, the firm must:", choices: [ "Immediately purchase or borrow the security","Within three settlement days purchase or borrow the security","Within 13 settlement days purchase or borrow the security","Within 35 settlement days purchase or borrow the security" ], answer: 0, explanation: "In order to further reduce the number of fail-to-deliver positions, the SEC adopted Rule 204 to Regulation SHO. Unless a certain exemption applies, broker-dealers that have a fail (as a result of not being able to deliver the equity security by the settlement date) are required to purchase or borrow the security immediately to close out the fail. If the firm is not in compliance with this rule, no short sales on this security are permitted by the broker-dealer or any broker-dealer for which this firm clears transactions unless it has borrowed or has arranged to borrow this security (preborrowed). This rule applies to all equity securities, whereas the 13-settlement-day rule applies only to those securities that have a large number of fails (threshold securities). <P>This rule will require a broker-dealer that sells an equity security to either deliver the security by settlement date (T + 3), or immediately purchase or borrow the security no later than the beginning of trading on the next settlement day (T + 4).

If the syndicate cannot resell the offering at the public offering price, it may suffer a loss. While the selling group also participates in the sale of the new issue, it does not run the risk of losses if the securities do not sell. Regarding choice (c), a customer who provides an indication of interest has no obligation of any kind." },

Registered representatives must be careful about how they refer to the OTCBB and the securities that are quoted on the system. It would be misleading to allow investors to believe that this is the Nasdaq market since, unlike Capital Market and NGM securities, Bulletin Board stocks do not need to meet listing standards." },

The gifts should be valued at the higher of the cost or market value. For example, if tickets to a concert have a face value of $90, but the tickets were purchased at a value of $150, the higher value would be used.

For example, a 3X leveraged ETF based on the Russell 2000 Index seeks to deliver three times the performance of that index. So, if the Russell 2000 Index rises by 1%, a leveraged ETF would increase by 3% before fees and expenses. Choice (a) would be suitable if the customer anticipated a decrease in the Russell 2000, choice (c) would be suitable if the customer wanted a return that was a multiple or higher return and anticipated a decrease in the Russell 2000, and choice (d) would be suitable if the customer only wanted to track the return of the Russell 2000." },

In active, competitive markets, such as those for Nasdaq Global Market securities, the inside offer can usually be used as the prevailing market price when calculating markups on sales to retail customers, since such quotes can typically be validated.  A quote is considered validated when (i) a competitive market for the security exists, (ii) interdealer sales occur with some frequency, and (iii) on the days when interdealer sales occur, they are consistently effected at prices at or around the quoted offers.  In this case the amount of the markup per share is $0.50 (21 - 20.50).      To determine the percentage markup, divide the amount of the markup (1/2) by the prevailing market price of 20.50 (0.50 / 20.50 = 2.44%)." },

For OTC equity securities that have no published inside market, the broker-dealer   may calculate the inside spread by contacting a minimum of two unaffiliated dealers for   price quotes and using the highest bid and lowest offer price to determine the spread. The   broker-dealer must document the name of each firm contacted and the quotes that were   received in determining the inside market.  The fixed amount depends on the price of the   order.

For example, a customer might give a broker-dealer an order to purchase 100 shares of stock.  The best quote for the stock by a market maker is 20 bid, 20.50  offered.  This means that the stock could be purchased by the customer for 20.50 plus a commission or markup.  Instead, the broker-dealer calls another broker-dealer who purchases the stock from the market maker at 20.50 and resells it to the first broker-dealer for 21.  The customer is then charged 21 plus a commission or markup.  The two broker-dealers then share the additional 50 cents that the customer pays.  This is a prohibited practice.    <P>Under certain circumstances, interpositioning is allowed.

This situation will occur if the NBB is on or above the upper price band, or the NBO is on or below the lower price band. The price bands established under the LULD are set at a percentage above and below the reference price. The reference price for each security is based on the opening price or quote on the primary listing exchange and, hereafter, on the trading that occurred over the preceding five minutes of trading. The objective is to require exchanges and FINRA to pause trading in a stock if the price moved by more than a specified percentage (usually 5% or 10%) in a five-minute period. The price bands for this security would be $36.00 (the lower band) and $44.00 (the upper band). In choice (a), the NBO ($36) is on the lower price band, which will trigger a trading pause. Choice (d) is an example of a straddle state, which occurs when one side of the market is outside the price bands. This refers to a situation when the NBB is below the lower price band or the NBO is above the upper price band. (The NBO is above $44.) The primary listing exchange is permitted, but not required to issue a trading pause if the security is in a straddle state. In choices (b) and (c), the security is in a regular state, which occurs at prices equal to or greater than the lower price band, or equal to or less than the higher price band (i.e., within the price bands) and will not affect trading." },

In many circumstances, this may create downward pressure on the price of the security in the secondary market and, for this reason, underwriters may try to discourage these types of sales. FINRA prohibits a member, or person associated with a member, from directly or indirectly recouping, or attempting to recoup, any portion of a commission or credit paid or awarded to an associated person for selling shares of a new issue that are subsequently flipped by a customer, unless the managing underwriter has assessed a penalty bid on the entire syndicate." },

For example, if a broker-dealer sells XYZ stock to a customer for 21 when the inside bid is 19.25 and the inside offer    is 20, the percentage of markup would be 5% ($1 markup divided by the inside offer of 20).        <P>However, in this situation the market is not active and competitive.

Additionally, a special trade modifier   (which varies depending on conditions and reporting system) is required if the trade occurred more than 10 seconds after the stop.

The definition goes on to state that a person who owns an option, right, warrant, or convertible and has exercised or tendered that security is  considered long the underlying stock even if it has not yet been received. A person is also long only to the extent she has a net-long position. In Choice (c), the sale must be marked short if entered on one ticket, because the customer is net-short 100 shares. Another way to handle this transaction would be to write two tickets, one for the sale of 500 shares (marked long) and one for the sale of 100 shares (marked short). In Choice (d), all accounts of the customer would be aggregated to determine the net position." },

However, there must be effective information barriers between the various trading desks at the member firm. Choice (a) is incorrect since there is no exception for retail orders.

The RR should recommend a sell stop at $63. A market order is not suitable since the client does not want to sell unless the price declines. A market order will not allow the client to receive further profits if the stock increases above $70. A sell limit is an order to sell at a specified price or higher and is usually placed above the current market price. Therefore, a sell limit at $63 is not suitable. Since the client never mentioned a specific limit selling price she is willing to accept, a stop limit order should not be recommended. In addition, a stop limit order may be activated but never executed, and the client would not be able to protect her profit." },

By adjusting the amount banks must keep on reserve at the FRB, the Fed can tighten or ease the money supply. If reserve requirements are lowered, the banks are able to extend more credit. Thus, the money supply increases. The opposite effect occurs with an increase in reserve requirements. After meeting its reserve requirement, a bank will look to lend the remaining funds to borrowers. The amount above the reserve requirement is called excess reserves." },

By buying a put, the investor could go into the market if the stock declined and buy the stock at a lower price. He would exercise the put and sell the stock to the writer at the exercise price. Buying a put costs less money than selling short because the short position requires a 50% deposit with a minimum margin deposit of $2,000. The investor will not sell (write) a put because the writer of a put option would profit if the market price increased above the strike price and the put expired worthless.

The index tends to move inversely with the S&P 500 Index. The VIX usually rises when the S&P 500 Index falls, and falls when the S&P 500 Index increases. An investor will buy calls when he expects the market to decline and volatility to increase. An investor will buy puts on the VIX if he expects the market to rise and volatility to decrease. Many investors will buy VIX call options as a hedge against a possible decline in the market. The VIX option can be used by investors who expect either an increase or a decrease in volatility." },

If a market order to sell is executed below $15.00, the managing underwriter will be required to drop the stabilizing price. Since the 1,200-share order will  be filled by executing 1,000 shares at 15.00 and 200 shares at 14.56, the last independent transaction will have occurred at 14.56.

Choice (b) is not an institutional account since the value must be at least $50,000,000. Choice (c) is false since a member firm may limit the life of the order to normal market hours.

As its definition implies, the act of stabilizing is generally manipulative. However, if it is performed in accordance with Rule 104 of Regulation M, stabilizing is allowed in order to realize the benefits of an orderly distribution of securities.  The highest price at which a stabilizing bid may be entered is the public offering price. The syndicate may only have one (not multiple) stabilizing bids, which is typically placed by the manager. Although there is only one stabilizing bid permitted, there is no limit as to the number of stabilizing purchases that may be made.

This latter phrase, \"regular and continuous\" basis, prohibits \"instant\" market makers from meeting the definition for the purposes of Rule 144 -- a dealer cannot initiate its market with a Rule 144 transaction.

SRO rules generally prohibit a firm from submitting a clearing report to a FINRA facility (e.g., the Trade Reporting Facility), unless the trade was previously reported to the same FINRA facility. A reporting member may not step out of a trade reported to the Exchange by reporting a clearing-only transaction to a different facility. In other words, to step out of a trade, a member must report the clearing step out on the same facility as the original trade report. An exception to this rule may occur in cases of riskless principal transactions, where one leg is reported to the FINRA facility (for dissemination to the public), while the other leg is reported as a clearing-only trade. Clearing-only trades are not reported to the Tape and are therefore not be disseminated to the public.

In this case, the customer's order would improve the market maker's quote since it is a buy order that is priced higher than the market maker's quote.

It is possible in certain circumstances to justify higher markups, but   conversely, there are times when 5% would be excessive. A markup pattern of 5% (or   less) may be considered unfair or unreasonable. Several factors are considered when   determining whether the broker-dealer compensation is excessive, such as the   security, its availability, price, total dollar amount involved, disclosure to the   customer, and the pattern of markups.

For example, if the POP is $15.00 and the issuer receives $13.95, the spread is $1.05. Choice (c) is referring to the spread of a Nasdaq market maker which is the difference between the price at which the firm is willing to buy (bid) and the price at which the firm is willing to sell (ask or offer) a security. Choice (a) is not defined as the spread since it does not include the manager's fee component. The markup or markdown is the difference between the prices the customer paid or received compared to the best bid or offer price of all Nasdaq market makers (the inside market).

When applying Reg. SHO to threshold securities, the rule states that if there is a fail to deliver in a threshold security by a broker-dealer, there will be a mandatory close-out of the short after either 13 settlement days or 35 settlement days. Reg. SHO uses the term settlement days synonymously with business days. Generally, all fails to deliver of threshold securities that have existed for 13 settlement days must be closed out by the broker-dealer on the morning of the 14th settlement day. However, in the event the security being sold is a Rule 144 security where its restrictions need to be removed before delivery can be made, Regulation SHO gives the broker-dealer 35 settlement days before the required close-out. This should not be confused with a customer bringing in Rule 144 securities to his broker-dealer to execute a long sale. In this case, if the restrictions have not been removed in 35 calendar days, the broker-dealer will be required to close out the position." },

A covered security is defined as any NMS security that is an equity security listed on the NYSE, Nasdaq, or the NYSE MKT.

    { text: "Rosewood Securities LLC has been accused of buying and selling securities for the purpose of creating artificial trading activity. Which of the following choices BEST describes this activity?", choices: [ "Churning","Matched orders","Capping","Stabilization" ], answer: 1, explanation: "A matched order is also known as painting the Tape. It is an illegal activity based on a group of market manipulators buying and/or selling a security among themselves to create artificial trading activity. The intention of this activity is to lure unsuspecting investors into trading the stock because of the appearance of unusual trading volume. The manipulators have already taken a position in the stock, and hope to influence the market (illegally) to make their position profitable through this fake heavy trading volume. Churning is a violation in which a salesperson effects a series of transactions in a customer's account that are excessive in size and/or frequency in relation to the size and investment objectives of the account. A salesperson churning an account is normally seeking to maximize her income (in commissions, sales credits or markups) derived from the account. Capping is a situation where a manipulator is attempting to stop a securities price from rising. <P> Stabilization is a practice used in connection with certain public offerings in which an underwriter posts an open bid for securities at a stated price. Stabilization is intended to maintain an orderly market for the securities during the underwriting and to prevent sharp fluctuations in the market for the securities due simply to supply factors. Properly disclosed, this is an acceptable practice." },

Which of the following aspects of the SEC penny stock rules would NOT apply to this customer?", choices: [ "The account would have to go through the penny stock account approval procedures under the \"Cold Call Rule\"","Y would have to provide the customer with a penny stock Risk Disclosure Document prior to effecting any covered transactions","For each penny stock transaction, Y would have to disclose the compensation that it receives for the transaction","If the customer purchases a penny stock through Y, the firm would have to provide the customer with a monthly statement describing the estimated market value of the security, as long as it holds the stock for the customer" ], answer: 0, explanation: "Prior to the purchase of a penny stock by a customer, a broker-dealer must (i) approve the person's account for penny stock transactions according to the procedures outlined in SEC Rule 15g-9, and (ii) obtain from the customer a written agreement to the transaction indicating the identity and quantity of the penny stock to be purchased.  There are several exceptions to this rule, including transactions for \"established\" customers.

If the stock is selling above parity, the value of the stock received from converting the bond is more than the value of the bond. An investor could sell the stock short and buy the bond, and then convert the bond and use the stock to cover the short position. For example, a bond convertible into 25 shares is trading at 104 and the stock is selling at $42. If an investor sold 25 shares short at $42 (equaling $1,050), that would be worth more than the value of the bond ($1,040)." },
